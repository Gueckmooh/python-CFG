* How to use it
  This program takes as input an elf file or an objdump of an elf file
  and gives as output a dot file that represents the CFG of the program.
  The name of a function can be specified to get only its CFG. 
  A "borring output" can be visualized, it contains the internal structure
  of the graph.
